    <p>The combination of Domine and Nunito Sans is meant to replicate, to an extent, the
    relationship between ITC Century and Futura. The opposing qualities in each font compliment
    each other directly. The juxtaposition between Nunito Sans' linear and geometric lettering,  and
    Domine's thick, rounded typography creates a cohesion that provides balance.</p>
    <p>Nunito Sans is a terminal typeface that removes any rounding and provides a more strict serif
    font. On the other hand, Domine provides a squared inside to it's rounded letters and a soft
    curve to it's curved letters to create a more "airy" typeface.</p>
