## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=10v0u0kpgpgf3xck9rPrPk9xcf3
Your Rationale: I decided to use the Orange at Hue: 31 degrees. This is because orange evokes
interest, without overpowering the end user. Orange is an interesting color in that it is a playful
color. The website for the console is meant to engage the user and retain their attention. Orange
does this perfectly.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens
